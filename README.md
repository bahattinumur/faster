<h1>FASTER</h1>

This is a car racing game created in the 90s Atari format using JavaScript. At the beginning of the game, we start with the “insert coin” message, just like at the beginning of an Atari game. We move our car forward and backward with the up-down arrow keys, and steer it right or left with the right-left arrow keys. If we collide with another car during the race, we are alerted with a horn sound, and we can go up to a maximum speed of 200 km/h. Have fun!
